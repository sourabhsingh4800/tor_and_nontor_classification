# Tor and Non-Tor Classification

## Overview

This project aims to classify network traffic into two categories: Tor and Non-Tor. Tor is an anonymity network that allows users to access the internet while concealing their identity, making it crucial to identify Tor traffic for various security and monitoring purposes.
